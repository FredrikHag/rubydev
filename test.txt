own consumer authentication, but don´t want to store the consumer information. Edit "Enterprise" on GitHub Enterprise is the option if you have a strong customer authentication login
and collect consumer information yourself, so you don’t need payer information
from us to calculate shipping costs. We store the consumer information for you
and offer the full range of available payment methods. Enterprise Redirect Seamless View There are two ways of integrating the  implementation.
 and . Redirect With , the payer is sent to a Swedbank Pay page, where we handle the
authentication and purchase process. The payer is redirected back to you when
the purchase is completed or if the payer aborts the purchase. The purchase page
will be styled by Swedbank Pay. Seamless View With , the payer stays at your site, and you initiate the
Swedbank Pay purchase module in an iframe. The purchase component will be styled
by Swedbank Pay. Read more about our two integration alternatives by clicking the links below. da-DK en-US fi-FI nb-NO sv-SE This product supports Danish , English (US) , Finnish ,
